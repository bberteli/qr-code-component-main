## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Today, I learned the 'box-sizing' property to make the divs behave as I intend them to.
I also had the chance to practice the process of converting the Sigma layout to an actual page, and finally, this is my first time writing a README.md file and linking some HTML to a Github Page.
